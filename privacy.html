            <p>Welcome to Feeding Benita Foundation! We take your privacy as seriously as we take feeding Benita—which is to say, very seriously. Here’s everything you need to know about how we handle your personal information:</p>
            
            <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your Name:</strong> So we know who to thank for helping feed Benita.</li>
                <li><strong>Your Email Address:</strong> For obvious reasons.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment Details:</strong> Don’t worry, we’ll only use these to buy food for Benita—nothing else.</li>
                <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Not the edible kind, sadly. These are small files that help us improve your experience. If you would like to give her real cookies, donate more to Benita.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>To feed Benita. That’s literally the entire point.</li>
                <li>To send you heartwarming updates about Benita’s full belly and happy face.</li>
                <li>To occasionally ask for more donations because, let’s face it, Benita eats a lot.</li>
                <li>To improve our website so you enjoy visiting as much as Benita enjoys her wings and poult mayo.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What We Don’t Do</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Sell Your Data: We’re here to feed Benita, not to sell your info.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Your Rights</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You can ask us to delete your info, but we might cry a little (don’t worry, we’ll do it).</li>
                <li>You can opt out of cookies, but Benita might miss you because cookies make the site work better.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Third Parties</h2>
            <p>We might work with third parties (like payment processors) to make sure your donations get straight to Benita’s plate. These parties are required to be just as nice and trustworthy as us.</p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>We guard your information like we guard Benita’s fufu—closely and with love. Our site uses encryption to keep your data safe from prying eyes.</p>

            <h2>Updates to This Policy</h2>
            <p>If we ever change this privacy policy, we promise to let you know in a way that’s as transparent as Benita’s chimichurri-covered fingers.</p>

            <h2>Contact Us</h2>
            <p>Have questions, concerns, or just want to say hi? Email us at <a href="mailto:support@feedingbenita.org">support@feedingbenita.org</a>, and we’ll get back to you faster than Benita can finish her wings.</p>

            <p class="text-center mt-5"><strong>Now that you know we’ve got your back (and your data), let’s get back to the important stuff—feeding Benita!</strong></p>
